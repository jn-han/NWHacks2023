# KIZUNAçµ†

This project is a livestreaming web application that implements LivePeer Studio's API for video Livestream and on demand to help create stronger communities in real time. 

The platform aims to increase exposure for small creators through alleviating the barriers of being a new streamer. Our project also aims to establish a more unified social ecosystem by providing users with a platform to interact on a deeper level.
